# SP80
This first version of SP80 is the same as the SP71 computer model but has been revised to take account of changes to MS Visual Studio and changes to VS C++ between 2005 and 2020. Most of that revision has been done, very kindly, by someone with a detailed knowledge of VS and the VS version of C++, both as they are now and as they have been at various stages in the past.

The most detailed descriptions of the thinking behind the SP Theory of Intelligence and its realisation in the SP Computer Model (SP71) is in the book "UNIFYING COMPUTING AND COGNITION: The SP Theory and its Applications", described in http://www.cognitionresearch.org/books/sp_book/fly_leaf.htm . To be precise, the book describes version SP70 of the program, but this is very similar to SP71.

In the book, the main chapters to look at are Chapters 3 and 9 but there is lots of relevant information in the rest of the book. 

Copies of the ebook or the printed book may be obtained from sources listed in http://www.cognitionresearch.org/books/sp_book/retailers.htm , including Amazon. A point to note about the printed book is that it is produced by print-on-demand by Lightning Source (UK) Ltd., Milton Keynes, UK. This has several advantages and is very fast but this feature of the book may need to be explained to some retailers, otherwise they may say, wrongly, that it is out of print. One of the several advantages of print-on-demand is that the book never goes out of print.

There is also relevant information in "The SP Theory of Intelligence: an overview" (PDF, Information, 4 (3), 283-341, 2013, bit.ly/1NOMJ6l), especially Sections 3, 4, and 5. This peer-reviewed paper is essentially a version of the book that is reduced in size. Inevitably, some useful information has been omitted.

There is yet more information about peer-reviewed papers and other documents near the top of http://www.cognitionresearch.org/sp.htm . There are download links for the great majority of these documents. 

Details of the more important papers, with download links, are given on http://www.cognitionresearch.org/extras/key_publications.htm . Amongst those papers, the ones that are even more important are marked with one, two, or three stars.
